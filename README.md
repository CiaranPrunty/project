Mobile Application Project.

For my project i created a survey application . Using different pages to link to each other , the user must answer five questions relative to their college experience. Results page outputs all answers entered. I wanted to add a function to create an overall comparison of different users to see which answers were relative to each other , unfortunatley I wasn't able to figure out this part. 


I encountered a lot of issues with the Git repository though as it wouldn't push to github. I'll provide a screenshot of said issue on the  moodle upload as i couldn't determine the issue.
